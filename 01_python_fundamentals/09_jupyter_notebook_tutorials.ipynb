    "In Jupyter Notebooks, a **kernel** is the computational engine responsible for executing code within the notebook. It processes the code you write and sends the results back to the notebook interface. The kernel operates independently from the notebook's user interface, meaning you can run multiple notebooks with different kernels simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points:\n",
    "- **Default Kernel**: By default, Jupyter uses the Python kernel (IPython) for executing Python code.\n",
    "- **Multiple Kernels**: Jupyter supports a variety of kernels for different languages such as Python, R, Julia, and others.\n",
    "- **Managing Kernels**: You can change, restart, or interrupt kernels from the Jupyter interface. Restarting clears all variables and imports in the current session, while interrupting stops a running code cell.\n",
    "- **Kernel Installation**: Additional kernels can be installed for other programming languages using the `ipykernel` package (for Python) or specific language packages like `IRkernel` (for R).\n",
